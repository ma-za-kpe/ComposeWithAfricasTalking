# ComposeWithAfricasTalking
- A simple project demonstrating the use of some of the Africa's talking API's in a 
jetpack compose way. 
- We also heavily utilise the android documentation, code labs, youtube videos, open source projects like nowinandroid, and so on. 
- This project is under heavy construction, and will remain as so, for the foreseen future. This project is built with scalability and expansion in mind.
